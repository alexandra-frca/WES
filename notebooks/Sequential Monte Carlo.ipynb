        "On the other hand, with Metropolis we expect that an equitative fraction of particles will gather around each mode. When the redundance is lifted, the ones covering the decoy mode should join the others around the true value. Even if that were not the case, in theory, a good Markov kernel could correct the problem, because it converges to the real distribution rather than the SMC approximation (or even a simplification thereof, as with LW).\n",
